A diagonal twist describes a situation where the panels your feet are hitting have an angle of between 90 and 180 degrees. We divide diagonal twists into three categories: close, far, and solo.

Far diagonal twists are where the panels your feet are hitting are not adjacent, for example red-blue. Far diagonal twists are often harder to execute than close diagonal twists, as they typically require substantially more movement and intention to execute.
