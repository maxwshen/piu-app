# Issues
## Front-end
- Very long charts do not display properly - probably fix by switching to timestamp based display
- Ugly Dee D15 holds aren't displayed properly
O Imagination S17 long hold isn't displayed properly. In general, very long holds are not displayed properly

## e_struct
x Very large NPS: Because it averages the time since downpress across notes in a second, it yields very large NPS. To fix: If NPS is large, just count the number of notes in the second. We don't always want to do this because it's not as smooth.

## Stepchart solving
O Trashy D15 has 180 twists, this shouldn't be the case
O Headless Chicken d21 double steps rather than do diagonal twists because of off beat timing
- Conflict S22/D24 do footswitches in beginning instead of jacks (minor)
- Delete Ugly Dee D11 (D15 exists)
- Missing ~25 charts or so (overnight laptop jobs)
