Drills are a series of notes (here, defined as 5 or more notes) that alternate between just two panels. Compared to runs at the same level, drills can demand higher speeds and length because in principle you can conserve much more energy on drills. Most players find blue-panel drills executed with heels much easier than red-panel drills that require toes, to the extent that some players even position their feet to perform red drills with their heels.

The infamous chart Rock the House D22 may not be listed as a top drill chart because the algorithm prefers to label very fast drills as bracket footswitches.
