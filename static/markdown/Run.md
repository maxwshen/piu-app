Runs, or streams, are a long series of notes with few or no special techniques. Runs begin with 8th notes (at 150 bpm, this is 5 notes per second) at lower levels (7+). Around level 16+, 16th-note runs start to become more common (at 150 bpm, this is 10 notes per second). The primary ways that runs become more difficult are:

- Length, e.g., Hyperion D21 shortcut has a run lasting 30 seconds
- Twistiness, e.g., by incorporating more diagonal or 180 twists
- Speed, e.g., 16th note runs at 200 bpm are 13.3 notes per second
- Movement/Travel: Requiring you to move to farther panels. These are more common in doubles, but in singles high-movement runs often only use corner arrows.

To improve at runs, it can be useful to practice each of these aspects separately.
